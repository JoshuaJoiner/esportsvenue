    <h2>About ArenaHub</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>ArenaHub</strong>, we believe esports events should feel effortless for organizers 
      and unforgettable for fans. We built this platform to bring everyone together in one place — 
      the organizers who plan, the fans who cheer, and the teams and coaches who compete.
    </p>
    <p>
      For organizers, ArenaHub takes the stress out of managing an event. Seating charts, ticket 
      sales, schedules, and brackets can all be handled in one simple system. Fans get more than 
      just a ticket to a match — they get access to real-time stats, interactive screens, and an 
      experience that makes them feel part of the action. Teams and coaches can focus on performance, 
      knowing they have the tools to stay organized and connected throughout the competition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Esports is about community, excitement, and shared energy. ArenaHub exists to capture that 
      spirit and make every event a place where players, fans, and organizers come together to create 
      something unforgettable.
